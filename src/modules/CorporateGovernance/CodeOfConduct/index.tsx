        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Emperor Holdings (the “Company”) is committed to creating a professional and ethical workplace and has
            adopted a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that applies to all directors, officers, trustees, employees (whether
            temporary, fixed-term, or permanent), trainees, volunteers, interns, or any other person associated with the
            Company (“Company Staff”). The Code also applies to all persons or entities acting on behalf of or at the
            direction of the Company (“Associated Persons”). Examples of Associated Persons include agents,
            intermediaries, professional advisors, and business partners. Shareholders of the Company may also be
            subject to the Code when they act on behalf of the Company as its agent or representative.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Code sets out the principles to guide Company Staff in carrying out their duties and responsibilities to
            the highest standards of personal and corporate integrity and professionalism when dealing with the Company,
            its competitors, clients, customers, investors, contractors, agents, suppliers, other Company Staff and the
            community. The Code sets the minimum standard that the Company expects of all Company Staff, regardless of
            the jurisdiction or legal entity through which the Company operates. Where appropriate, the Code can be
            supplemented by additional specific requirements related to a country, entity, or business unit. It is the
            responsibility of all Company Staff to comply with the spirit and principles of the Code, as amended from
            time to time.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) are all
            specifically tasked with ensuring that the Company meets the highest legal and ethical standards in its
            business dealings and to ensure that all Company Staff and Associated Persons comply with this Code. The CFO
            is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of this Code and all reports, reviews and records relating
            to this Code.

            In addition to the Code, Company expects Company Staff to comply with all laws, regulations, codes of
            practice, and legal, regulatory, and licensing requirements applicable to the different jurisdictions where
            it operates, including the laws of the Cayman Islands, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Company Staff
            should not engage in any activity that adversely affects the Company’s interests or reputation, including
            but not limited to, engaging in any act whether in the workplace or otherwise that, in the sole discretion
            of the Company, involves violent behaviour, moral wrongdoings, or which constitutes a criminal act under any
            applicable laws, regulations and legal requirements, regardless of whether the Company Staff is criminally
            charged or convicted. Crimes specifical to the financial services sector, such as bribery, corruption, money
            laundering, financing terrorism, international sanctions, and other illegal activity shall be prevented and
            reported to the relevant authorities in full compliance with all applicable laws.

            All Company Staff agree that compliance with all of Company’s Policies and Procedures is a mandatory
            requirement and expectation of their employment.

        <h2 className={styles.title}>4. Workplace Health and Safety</h2>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Company is committed to provide a healthy and safe work environment for Company Staff, customers,
            business partners and visitors. Every Company Staff has a personal responsibility to support this
            commitment.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff are obliged to carry out their work in a safe manner, without causing harm to themselves or
            others, and to report any potentially unsafe or unhealthy situations immediately. They must observe and
            follow all safety and environmental regulations laid down in the operation instructions, including putting
            on the necessary safety equipment, and conduct specific risk assessment prior to carrying out any works
            including team building activities, where applicable.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            All Company Staff must observe the rules of office security where they work including a total ban and
            zero-tolerance for the use or possession of dangerous weapons while on Company property or when working on
            behalf of the Company including, but not limited to: guns, knives, swords, explosives, tasers, pepper or
            chemical sprays, etc. Exceptions to this ban on dangerous weapons may be made for designated security
            officers in compliance with local laws and regulations.
          </p>

        <h2 className={styles.title}>5. Company Property and Assets</h2>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff are responsible for Company property entrusted to them. This property includes, but is not
            limited to, physical property (such as phones, documents, books, Company vehicles, or computers), records
            (such as data on customers and Company records), and intangible property (such as computer software, IT
            materials, and computer records). It is important that, whichever category the property falls into, Company
            Staff must treat Company’s property as they would their own and must not damage it, deface it or remove it
            for personal use, unless authorised to do so.
          </p>

        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must use office computers, or terminals, only in the way in which they have been instructed.
            They should protect their own password and not use anyone else's ID or password to access records. Unless
            authorised, Company Staff must not alter records or software instructions. They must always ensure that any
            software they use has been obtained from authorised suppliers and should only install software if they are
            permitted to do so.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Just as they must not misuse Company property, they must not dispose of any Company property in an
            unauthorised manner, such as by selling, loaning, or giving it away without proper permission.

        <h2 className={styles.title}>7. Official Records </h2>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Information and official records are a valuable asset of the Company and its integrity depends on the
            honesty, completeness and accuracy of its records. This means that anyone preparing the Company’s records
            and reports must be diligent in assuring the accuracy and completeness of all data, records, reports, and
            expenditure connected with the Company.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must keep copies of Company records such as installation data, customer records and test data
            at a safe location. For financial record keeping purposes, Company Staff must not engage in any practice or
            procedure which might conceal, facilitate, or constitute bribery, kickbacks, improper gratuities or other
            illegal or improper payments or receipts, or which might appear as such. These record-keeping requirements
            are discussed in more detail in the Company’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.

        <h2 className={styles.title}> 8. Proprietary Information & Intellectual Property </h2>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Many Company Staff have access to information, including trade secrets, know-how used by the Company to
            distinguish its businesses and services from those of competitors, as well as sensitive private business
            information of a commercial, technical, or financial nature such as prospects, agreements with customers,
            investment information, business strategies, business partners, competitors, account plans, business
            proposals, negotiations and contracts.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            It is important that all Company proprietary information be kept confidential. Company Staff have a duty to
            safeguard this information, bearing in mind ethical, legal ramifications and government regulations.
            Information of commercial value or of a sensitive nature must be tightly controlled. For example, when
            releasing information to a third party a Non-Disclosure Agreement should be signed, and information released
            on a need-to-know basis.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Any trademark, copyrights, patents, designs, registered designs, proprietary information and all other
            intellectual property rights developed and commissioned by the Company belong to the Company. Company Staff
            are reminded not to infringe any third parties' rights including, but not limited to, any third party
            intellectual property rights, copyrights, patents and trademarks. The Company will hold exclusive property
            of any invention, discovery, design or improvements made. This could also include inventions Company Staff
            may create which relate to the Company’s business, regardless of whether the invention or designs are
            patentable or are capable of being registered or copyrighted.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must report these inventions to the CFO and shall, at the Company's request and expense,
            disclose information relating to the invention and do what is required to obtain patents or industrial
            rights relating to the invention. The patents will be in Company’s name or its nominee and Company Staff
            will not be entitled to any payment for the invention. The Company's ownership of any intellectual property
            created by Company Staff while with the Company continues after they have left the Company.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            When Company Staff leave the Company for any reason, including retirement, they must return all the
            Company’s property, including all documents and records in their possession, and they must not disclose or
            misuse Company confidential information. Company Staff are also responsible for protecting information
            provided in confidence by any third party, such as a customer, investor, supplier or a partner, after they
            leave the Company.

            entity (i) in which the Company may have an interest (equity or otherwise) or (ii) to whom the Company owes
            an obligation (whether pursuant to a contract or otherwise). Such secret, confidential or proprietary

            also focus on their Company related work and responsibilities and not be distracted by other work or
            personal activities while working on behalf of Company. They must act sensibly and conduct themselves
            whether at work or outside of work in a manner that upholds the integrity, reputation, and values of the
            Company.

            The Company is committed to provide Company Staff with a work environment which is conducive, safe, and free
            from discrimination and harassment. Company Staff should always treat their colleagues and other persons
            with respect and consideration. Workplace harassment can occur when one party demonstrates behaviour that
            causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to another party. Examples of behaviour that may

          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Company will not tolerate any acts of discrimination or harassment and will investigate all complaints

            employment conditions for all Company Staff so that all are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness.
            Work-related decisions must be made on the grounds of professional and objective criteria and not on
            personal bias. No Company Staff shall be discriminated against based on their ethnicity, gender, religion,
            sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics protected by law.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>

            Supervisors and managers must not abuse their authority and should treat all Company Staff equally and

        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            A ‘conflict of interest’ arises when Company Staff have a competing professional or personal interest that
            would either make it difficult to fulfil their duties properly or would create an appearance of impropriety
            that could undermine customer, investor, or public confidence. Company Staff must do nothing that conflicts
            with the interests of the Company, or anything that could be construed as being in conflict, for example,
            participating in the evaluation/approval of award to a vendor in which a Company Staff has a vested interest
            (either personally, or through close relatives). Company Staff should declare/disqualify themselves from
            handling transactions which put them, whether perceived or real, in a position of conflict.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must avoid all situations which could result in conflicts of interest. They should comply with
            reporting and disclosure requirements of potential or actual conflicts of interest and disclose any matters
            which could reasonably be expected to interfere with their professional duties.

            Company Staff should not engage in any outside business dealings that involve or could appear to involve, a

          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must not have any direct or indirect financial or business interest in or dealings with
            competitors, suppliers, customers, or anyone else with whom they are engaged in a business relationship on
            behalf of the Group, which might or might appear to, create a conflict of interest, or impair the judgments
            they make on behalf of the Company. They should also not engage in any personal business dealings which
            detract from or conflict with their employment in Company.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Company Staff must avoid situations where their loyalties may be divided between the Company's interest and
            those of a customer, investor, supplier, or competitor. Company Staff must not take advantage of any
            opportunity for personal gain that rightfully belongs to Company. They should avoid putting themselves in
            any situation which might or might appear to put them at a personal advantage, and they must report any
            potentially compromising situation to their supervisors promptly.

            All outside appointments and activities (including business activities), directorships and employment must
            be declared and approved in advance. If Company Staff are considering accepting an external appointment,
            they must consider if accepting this position may give rise to the possibility of a conflict of interest. If
            they have been given permission to take on such employment or to have other business relationships, they
            must ensure that these activities do not negatively affect their ability to fully and effectively perform
            their role for Company or Company's reputation and/or its services to customers or investors or Company’s
            current or future business plans.

        <p className={styles.text}>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            When dealing with issues involving gifts or hospitality (both given or received), Company Staff and
            Associated Persons must comply fully with the Company Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, which
            specifically addresses these issues. Where there is a perceived conflict between this Code and the
            Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, the latter shall be controlling and interpreted more strictly in
            favour of prohibiting the gift or hospitality. Generally, the acceptance of gifts or hospitality
            events/invitations from customers, existing and/or potential, business partners, suppliers, contractors,
            competitors, investors, or members of the public is discouraged and often prohibited as it may create a
            potential conflict of interest. Where circumstances make it impossible, difficult, or impractical to reject
            the gifts or hospitality events/invitations, Company Staff should immediately declare such gifts or
            hospitality events/invitations to their supervisors and the CFO. This applies to all except perishables and
            those of a token value. When in doubt whether the gift or hospitality event/invitation can be accepted, the
            Company Staff should contact the CFO directly for guidance and declare the items.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Business lunches/dinners are an accepted mode of hospitality, but care must be exercised while accepting
            such meals. These should be infrequent and non-lavish and should be recorded. The sole purpose for these
            meetings must be for enhancement of a business relationship and not for reciprocity or for personal benefit.{' '}
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            It is the Company's policy not to accept hospitality events or invitations which involve air travel and/or
            accommodation. Company Staff may accept the invitation only if the cost of the air travel and/or
            accommodation (including related expenses) is fully borne by the Company and with the CFO’s prior approval.
            The CFO must ensure that the Company Staff's acceptance does not create any conflict of interest or
            potential conflict of interest in Company's existing or future business dealings with the inviting party or
            bring disrepute in any form or manner to the Company. The CFO must also ensure it complies with the Company
            Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and all applicable laws.
