          Emperor Holdings (the “Company”) adopted this Anti-Bribery Policy (the “Policy”) to comply with the
          requirements and restrictions of the Cayman Islands' Anti-Corruption Law, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
          U.K. Bribery Act, and other applicable anti-bribery laws worldwide that may apply to the Company and its
          subsidiaries, partnerships, ventures, third parties, associated entities/persons, or other business
          associations that are effectively controlled by the Company, either directly or indirectly. Offering, paying,
          soliciting, or accepting bribes in any form are serious criminal offenses in most countries and many
          anti-bribery laws apply extraterritorially to activity both within and outside those countries. This Policy
          sets out the responsibilities of the Company and those who work for and with the Company to uphold our
          zero-tolerance position on bribery and corruption. It also serves as a source of information and guidance to

        <h2 className={styles.title}>3 POLICY STATEMENT</h2>
        <div className={styles.text}>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Company is committed to conducting business in an ethical and honest manner by implementing and
            enforcing this Policy to ensure that bribery and corruption are prevented. The Company has a zero-tolerance
            for bribery and corrupt activities. Compliance with this Policy is the responsibility of everyone at the
            Company. The Company will abide by the letter and spirit of applicable anti-bribery laws in conducting its
            business in all the relevant jurisdictions where the Company operates. Promising, authorizing, offering,
            giving, accepting or soliciting, directly or indirectly, anything of value, or any improper advantage, to
            anyone, with the intention or appearance of improperly influencing his or her decisions or conduct, or as a
            reward for improper performance, is strictly prohibited.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Company is committed to complying with its obligations under the applicable anti-bribery laws. As a
            corporation registered in the Cayman Islands, the Company is subject to the Cayman Islands' Anti-Corruption
            Law (“Cayman ACL”). As a corporation doing business within the United States of America and the United
            Kingdom, the Company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery
            Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”). In addition to the Cayman ACL, FCPA and the Bribery Act, the Company may also
            be subject to other anti-bribery laws around the world. The Company recognises that the Company and Company
            Staff are bound by these laws regarding their conduct both within these jurisdictions, and abroad.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Cayman ACL was adopted with the intent of giving effect to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of
            Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, as well as the United Nations Convention
            Against Corruption. The Cayman ACL provides generally for four categories of corruption offences: Bribery
            (both domestic and foreign); Fraud on the Government; Abuses of Public or Elected Office; and Secret
            Commissions. There are also ancillary offences for failure to report an offence. Violation of the Cayman ACL
            may lead to possible imprisonment and other criminal penalties.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            The FCPA is a law with criminal provisions that prohibits promising, authorizing, offering or giving
            anything of value, directly or indirectly, to non-U.S. government officials (a broad term that includes
            employees at all levels of non-U.S. governments, as well as employees of state-owned or state-controlled
            commercial enterprises, such as a state-owned financial institution, and non-U.S. political candidates,
            political parties, or party officials, and public international organizations) to influence any act or
            decision of a non-U.S. official in his or her official capacity. The FCPA applies to the conduct of the
            Company and Company Staff worldwide. The Company is also subject to other laws and regulations regarding
            business gratuities that may be accepted by U.S. government personnel.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            The Company and Company staff must also comply with the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits both bribes to
            government officials and commercial bribery. The Bribery Act makes it a criminal offense to offer, promise
            or give a bribe (which for the purposes of this Anti-Bribery Policy means a financial or other advantage);
            to request, agree to receive or to accept a bribe; or to bribe a foreign public official. The Company may
            also be held vicariously liable for failing to prevent bribery undertaken on its behalf and is obligated to
            implement adequate procedures to prevent bribery by those performing services for or on behalf of the
            Company, including services provided by subsidiaries.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            It is strictly prohibited to give, promise, or offer anything of value to a government official of any
            country in violation of anti-bribery laws, or to make illegal payments to third parties while knowing or
            having reason to know that any portion will be offered, given, or promised to such an official. Facilitation
            payments – payments to expedite or secure the performance of a routine government action – are also
            prohibited.
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            Finally, many anti-bribery laws prohibit promising, offering or paying bribes or kickbacks to private
            parties. This Policy prohibits promising, authorizing, offering, giving, accepting or soliciting anything of
            value or any other advantage to any person—including a client, potential client, vendor, or other business
            partner—with the intention of or giving the appearance of improperly influencing or rewarding the
            recipient’s business decisions.

            <h3 className={styles.subtitle}>5.2 Bribes</h3>
            <p>
              Bribery refers to the act of offering, giving, promising, asking, agreeing, receiving, accepting, or
              soliciting something of value or of an advantage so to induce or influence an action or decision. Bribery
              is not limited to the act of offering a bribe. If an individual is on the receiving end of a bribe and
              they accept it, they are also committing an act of bribery. Bribery is illegal whether it be done directly
              or indirectly, or through a third party.
            </p>
            <ol className={styles.ol}>
              <li>
                A bribe is an inducement or reward offered, promised or provided in order to gain any commercial,
                contractual, regulatory or business or personal advantage.
              </li>
              <li>An inducement is something which helps to bring about an action or desired result.</li>
              <li>
                A business advantage means that the Company is placed in a better position (financially, economically,
                or reputationally, or in any other way which is beneficial) either than its competitors or than it would
                otherwise have been had the bribery or corruption not taken place.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div className={styles.paragraph}>
            <h3 className={styles.subtitle}>5.3 Kickbacks</h3>
            The Company does not allow kickbacks to be made or accepted. Kickbacks are payment of any portion of a
            contract made to employees of another contracting party or the utilisation of other techniques, such as
            subcontracts, purchase orders or consulting agreements, to channel payment to public officials, political
            parties, party officials or political candidates, to employees of another contracting party, or their
            relatives or business associates.

            <h3 className={styles.subtitle}>5.4 Facilitation Payments</h3>
            The Company does not accept and will not make any form of facilitation payments. The Company recognises that
            facilitation payments are a form of bribery that involves expediting or facilitating the performance of a
            public official for a routine governmental action. Facilitation payments tend to be made by low level
            officials with the intention of securing or speeding up the performance of a certain duty or action.
